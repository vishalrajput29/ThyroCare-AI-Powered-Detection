# ThyroCare: AI-Powered Detection

This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect thyroid disease based on various patient features. Thyroid diseases, such as hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, can have significant health impacts if left undiagnosed. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of machine learning algorithms to classify whether a patient has a thyroid condition. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool to assist healthcare professionals in identifying thyroid disorders early, leading to better patient outcomes.

## Data Description


1. **age**: The age of the patient.

2. **sex**: The gender of the patient (`M` for male, `F` for female).

3. **on_thyroxine**: Indicates whether the patient is on thyroxine medication (`t` for true, `f` for false).

4. **query_on_thyroxine**: Indicates if there is a query about the patient being on thyroxine medication.

5. **on_antithyroid_medication**: Indicates whether the patient is on anti-thyroid medication.

6. **sick**: Indicates whether the patient is currently sick.

7. **pregnant**: Indicates whether the patient is pregnant.

8. **thyroid_surgery**: Indicates whether the patient has undergone thyroid surgery.

9. **I131_treatment**: Indicates if the patient has received I131 treatment, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism.

10. **query_hypothyroid**: Indicates if there is a query about the patient being hypothyroid.

11. **query_hyperthyroid**: Indicates if there is a query about the patient being hyperthyroid.

12. **lithium**: Indicates if the patient is on lithium medication, which can affect thyroid function.

13. **goitre**: Indicates whether the patient has a goitre (enlargement of the thyroid gland).

14. **tumor**: Indicates whether the patient has a tumor.

15. **hypopituitary**: Indicates whether the patient has hypopituitarism (reduced hormone production by the pituitary gland).

16. **psych**: Indicates whether the patient has psychological disorders.

17. **TSH_measured**: Indicates whether the Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was measured.

18. **TSH**: The value of the TSH measurement, if available.

19. **T3_measured**: Indicates whether Triiodothyronine (T3) hormone was measured.

20. **T3**: The value of the T3 measurement, if available.

21. **TT4_measured**: Indicates whether Total Thyroxine (TT4) hormone was measured.

22. **TT4**: The value of the TT4 measurement, if available.

23. **T4U_measured**: Indicates whether Thyroxine Binding Globulin (T4U) was measured.

24. **T4U**: The value of the T4U measurement, if available.

25. **FTI_measured**: Indicates whether the Free Thyroxine Index (FTI) was measured.

26. **FTI**: The value of the FTI measurement, if available.

27. **TBG_measured**: Indicates whether Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG) was measured.

28. **TBG**: The value of the TBG measurement, if available.

29. **referral_source**: The source of the referral (e.g., SVHC, SVI, other).

30. **Class**: The target variable indicating whether the patient is `hypothyroid`, `hyperthyroid`, or `negative` (no thyroid disease).
